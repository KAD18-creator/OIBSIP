         <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar ( 14 April 1891 - 6 December 1956) was an Indian economist, jurist, social reformer and political leader who   chaired the committee that drafted the Constitution of India based on the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India and the first draft of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau. Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru. He later converted to Buddhism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism. <br> <br>  After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits. <br> <br>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".

                <p>“I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.”</p><br>
                <p>“Freedom of mind is the real freedom. A person whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man. One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead. Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence.”</p><br>
                <p>“Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.”</p><br>
                <p>“Life should be great rather than long.”</p><br>
                <p>“Humans are mortal. So are ideas. An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs watering. Otherwise both will wither and die.”</p><br>
                <p>“Equality may be a fiction but nonetheless one must accept it as a governing principle.”</p><br>
                <p>“I like the religion that teaches liberty, equality and fraternity.”</p><br>
                <p>“A great man is different from an eminent one in that he is ready to be the servant of the society.”</p><br>
